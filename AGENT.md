# AGENT.md

This repository serves as a quick-start tutorial for building interactive AI agents using the Anthropic Claude Agent SDK in Python. It showcases the integration of custom tools and conversational interfaces within an agent-based system.

**Key Technologies/Frameworks**:
- Anthropic Claude Agent SDK
- Python
- python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
- numexpr (for safe expression evaluation in tools)
- anyio (for asynchronous operations)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Main Features**:
- Basic Claude API queries
- Interactive terminal-based chat interfaces (with and without history)
- Integration of custom tools (demonstrated with a calculator)
- Support for MCP servers
- Configurable permission modes for tool usage

**Architectural Patterns**:
- Agent-based architecture for AI systems
- Tool-use pattern for extending agent capabilities
- Conversational AI design principles
